"""
Eval: email_alert_agent (function tool).

The email tool reads the prediction CSV from the hardcoded pipeline path
(prediction_pipeline/data/processed/), which is written by seeded_eval_db.
No patching needed — the CSV path is consistent.

Checks:
  - fetch_delayed_orders_for_email function tool was called
  - EmailsList schema is valid
  - At least one email generated
  - Template subject line matches severity (Urgent/Moderate/Minor)
  - email_content is non-trivially long
  - LLM-as-judge scores email tone and personalisation
  - latency within budget
