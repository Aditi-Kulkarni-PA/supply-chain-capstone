Supply Chain Delivery – Conversational Chat UI (Gradio).

Key logic:
    - Implements a two-column Gradio UI: left (chat, controls), right (output tabs)
    - Handles all agent orchestration, plan confirmation, and output streaming
    - Action plan confirmation: shows plan, waits for user confirmation, then executes
    - Supports quick-action buttons, file upload, and multi-tool queries
    - All outputs (chat, tables, markdown, files) are updated in a single handler yield
    - Sidecar freshness helpers ensure pipeline outputs are reused if fresh
    - Welcome/help message shown on load, after clear, and after each analysis
