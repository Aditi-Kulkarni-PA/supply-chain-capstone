## 1. Problem Statement

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Last-mile delivery is the most expensive and delay-prone segment of the supply chain, accounting for 41–53% of total logistics costs (Statista, "Last Mile Share of Total Shipping Costs," 2018–2023 e-commerce benchmark). This project builds an AI system that predicts delivery delays before they happen, diagnoses root causes from historical patterns, simulates what-if scenarios, generates SLA-grounded optimization recommendations, and drafts personalised customer email alerts — all orchestrated through a conversational multi-agent interface.

## 2. Why Multi-Agentic AI? — Problem Fit Justification

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

This project deliberately combines classical ML with a multi-agent AI system, and each layer is justified by the nature of the task.

**The prediction layer uses classical ML** (two-stage Random Forest) because delay classification is a well-defined tabular task: fixed input features, binary and multi-class targets, and ground-truth labels for supervised training. A classifier is the right tool — fast, interpretable, and does not require language generation.

**The LLM agent layer addresses tasks where rule-based or deterministic systems would produce brittle, non-contextual outputs:**

- **Prediction inference narration** — explaining which feature combinations are causing delays and providing plain-English inference per record (`llm_insights`). A deterministic template cannot vary reasoning across 85+ features and their interactions.
- **Diagnosis narration** — identifying which feature combinations (e.g. `same_day × stormy × long distance`) drive today's delay spike requires synthesising across multiple summary tables and narrating the interaction. A heuristic cannot produce contextual root cause explanations.
- **Simulation reasoning** — translating a natural-language what-if scenario (*"what if weather turns stormy in the East region?"*) into database filters and enriching every result row with a cause-and-effect explanation requires language understanding and generation.
- **Recommendation generation** — producing non-generic, SLA-cited recommendations that reference specific penalty clauses, escalation tiers, and today's data requires grounding language generation in retrieved policy context (RAG). No rule-based system can do this without encoding every SLA clause as a hand-crafted rule.
- **Customer email drafting** — severity-appropriate, personalised email language requires natural language generation; template filling produces robotic, low-quality customer communication.

**The multi-agent orchestration layer is necessary — not incidental — for three reasons:**

1. **Task decomposition across specialist domains.** Prediction, diagnosis, simulation, recommendation, and alerting are five distinct capabilities with different tools, data sources, and output contracts. A single monolithic agent with all tools attached would receive conflicting instructions, mix output schemas, and be impossible to debug. Separate specialist agents — each with one tool, one Pydantic schema, one focused prompt — keep each capability independently testable and replaceable.

2. **Enforced dependency chains.** Diagnosis requires prediction data in SQLite; recommendations require diagnosis patterns to ground SLA citations. Multi-agent orchestration makes these data dependencies explicit and machine-enforceable through the Master Orchestrator's prerequisite logic and freshness sidecar gates — a single-agent or pipeline approach cannot enforce this at the tool-call level.

3. **Natural language as the user interface across a complex workflow.** Operations teams need to query predictions, run simulations, and request recommendations through a single conversational interface without knowing which tools to invoke or in what order. The Master Orchestrator interprets intent, builds and confirms an action plan, routes to the correct specialist agents in sequence, and assembles structured outputs — a workflow that is not achievable with deterministic heuristics or a single-step LLM call.

The system avoids the common pitfall of forcing AI where simpler tools suffice. Classical ML handles structured tabular classification; deterministic Python handles email generation; the multi-agent layer handles tasks that require language understanding, sequential reasoning, and coordination across specialist domains.

### ML Training and Test Data

Delivery Logistics Dataset (India – Multi‑Partner) Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kundanbedmutha/delivery-logistics-dataset-india-multi-partner downloaded and saved as Delivery_Logistics.csv

The primary training dataset contains 25,000 historical delivery records representing operations across India's five geographic regions and four delivery modes. The dataset reflects realistic patterns in last-mile logistics, including seasonal weather variation, partner performance variability, operational conditions, package characteristics, environmental factors, and delivery outcomes.

| **Daily test data** | `generate_daily_test_data_11.py` resamples and updates `Delivery_Logistics.csv` to produce daily inference batches (5 000 rows, 74/26 on-time/delayed ratio) — project-owned, restricted access |

### SLA / Policy Corpus (RAG Knowledge Base)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Source file** | `supply_chain_delivery_app/knowledge/delivery_sla_github_ready.md` |
| **Type** | Custom-authored policy document |
| **Content** | 36-section SLA/OLA document covering performance targets, penalty thresholds, escalation tiers, partner benchmarks, weather policies, distance guidelines, and improvement priorities |
| **Modelled on** | Industry-standard last-mile delivery SLA frameworks |
| **Licence** | Project-owned, restricted access (evaluation only) |
| **Justification** | No publicly available, legally usable SLA document exists for last-mile delivery at the required granularity. A custom-authored document ensures the RAG corpus is legally usable, domain-appropriate, and contains the specific clause structure needed to ground recommendations in verifiable policy references. |

## 4. System Overview

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

The project is structured around two closely integrated sub-systems that together form an AI-assisted control tower for last-mile logistics operations.

### Sub-System 1 — ML Prediction Pipeline (`prediction_pipeline/`)

A self-contained Python module responsible for all machine learning concerns: data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, daily inference, and database writes. It exposes its capabilities to the agent layer through a FastMCP server over stdio transport — see [`docs/06-mcp-server-design.md`](docs/06-mcp-server-design.md) for tool contracts and design decisions.

Key responsibilities:
- Load raw CSV files, inspect data quality, and apply cleaning rules
- EDA for data understanding (19 features derived from 17 raw input columns)
- Model selection across Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Finalised on Recall as primary metric
- Two-stage Random Forest inference: 
    - Stage 1 binary delay classification → identify orders that can get delayed
    - Stage 2 severity classification (Short / Medium / Long) for delayed orders only
- Persist predictions and aggregate summaries to SQLite (27 tables)
- Serve predictions to the delivery app via MCP stdio transport

**Key ML design decisions:**
- **Two-stage vs single multi-class model** — a single 4-class model (on-time / short / medium / long) would be dominated by the 73% on-time class. Splitting into two sequential stages lets Stage 1 independently maximise recall (catching all delays) and Stage 2 independently optimise severity accuracy across a more balanced 3-class problem.
- **Recall as primary optimisation metric** — a missed delay (false negative) is operationally far more costly than a false alarm (false positive): a missed delay means no corrective action; a false alarm means a slightly unnecessary intervention. GridSearchCV was run with `scoring='recall'` to align model selection with business cost asymmetry.

### Sub-System 2 — Supply Chain Delivery App (`supply_chain_delivery_app/`)

A Gradio web application providing the user interface and multi-agent orchestration logic. Users interact through a conversational chat panel; the Master Orchestrator agent interprets intent, calls the appropriate specialist sub-agents in sequence, and populates five output tabs with structured results. Informational questions (e.g. “which region was worst today?”) are answered directly in chat from fresh existing results, without re-running the pipeline.

Key responsibilities:
- Render the Gradio UI (chat panel + 5 result tabs)
- Detect user intent and map it to tool chains
- Orchestrate 8 AI agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK (Master Orchestrator + 6 specialists + Fallback Advisor)
- Retrieve SLA policy context via three-stage RAG (ChromaDB → hybrid scoring → cross-encoder reranking)
- Process structured Pydantic agent outputs and render them as interactive tables and Markdown
- LLM-as-judge and RAGAS used for agent and RAG performance evaluation

Taken together, the system enables logistics operations teams to query a conversational interface in natural language and receive structured, data-driven intelligence across five output domains: **predictions, root-cause diagnosis, what-if simulations, optimisation recommendations, and customer email alerts**.

## 8. Prompt Engineering

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Prompt instructions are split across three composable files — `security_guardrails.md`, `chatbot_behavior.md`, and `master_expert.md` — assembled at runtime by `get_instruction()` in `supply_chain_delivery_app/config/load_config.py`; rather than hardcoded as a single monolithic string. This separation keeps each concern independently editable and testable: guardrail rules can be tightened without touching agent logic, persona and tone can be adjusted without risking security regressions, and domain expertise can be iterated on without re-reviewing the full prompt. The layered order (security first, always) enforces a clear precedence hierarchy that a single flat prompt cannot guarantee. The design evolved through 19 iterations across 7 agents, each driven by a specific failure mode observed during development or testing.

### Prompt Version History

| Phase | Change | Problem Solved | Files Affected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 → 2 | Extracted security, behaviour, formatting into shared files | Maintenance burden, security deprioritisation, formatting drift | All prompt files, `load_config.py` |
| 2 → 3.1 | Added `llm_insights` enrichment instruction | Per-row explanations missing entirely | `predict_delivery_delays.md` |
| 3.1 → 3.2 | Added derived feature glossary | Generic, non-specific insights | `predict_delivery_delays.md` |
| 3.2 → 3.3 | Narrowed output to 2-field schema | Parsing errors, missed rows, extra fields | `predict_delivery_delays.md` |
| 3.3 → 3.4 | Added 2 few-shot examples | Near-identical insights across rows | `predict_delivery_delays.md` |
| 3.4 → 3.5 | Enforced ≥2 feature rule + `predict_summary` template | Single-dimension reasoning, weak summaries | `predict_delivery_delays.md` |
| 4.1 | Pydantic split: deterministic structure + LLM prose only | Short, unstructured diagnosis summaries | `diagnose_delay_patterns.md` |
| 4.2 | Field glossary for derived columns | Root cause missing; surface-level observations only | `diagnose_delay_patterns.md` |
| 4.3 | Mandatory section ordering + formatting rules | Inconsistent summary layout between runs | `diagnose_delay_patterns.md` |
| 5.1 | Tool returns dimension-level + combo-level data | Generic recommendations with no specifics | `recommendation.md`, tool |
| 5.2 | RAG-retrieved SLA context appended to tool output | Recommendations ungrounded in SLA/OLA | `recommendation.md`, tool |
| 5.3 | Three-category structure (quick-win/short/long-term) | No temporal prioritisation | `recommendation.md` |
| 6.1 | Email generation moved to tool (deterministic Python) | Format inconsistency, template invention, coverage gaps | `email_alert.md`, tool |
| 6.2 | Negative constraints: no individual generation | Agent re-generating emails on top of tool output | `email_alert.md` |
| 7.1 | Valid values list for filter/change parameters | Tool errors from invalid filter values | `delay_simulation.md` |
| 7.2 | Row parity rule ("same number of rows as tool") | Partial enrichment (5-10 rows out of 50+) | `delay_simulation.md` |
| 7.3 | Pydantic fields enforce concise comparative reason format | Free-form verbosity, inconsistent reason length | `delay_simulation.md` |
| 8.1 | WYSIWYG loader — prompt files passed to agents verbatim; master's duplicated interaction rules replaced with a pointer to the shared behaviour layer | Sections outside Role/Goal/Backstory/Task silently dropped (predict agent saw 28% of its prompt); same rules fed to the master twice | All prompt files, `load_config.py` |
| 8.2 | Testing-driven fixes: capped sample transcription (full results read from CSV on disk); synonym mapping to valid enums + tool-error passthrough; `chat_response` conversational contract + PLAN CONFIRMED tag; bold-values + plain-language summary rules | 241-row transcription collapsed to empty output; "severe weather" → invalid value reported as "ran, no changes"; questions forced into action plans + double confirmation; key numbers didn't stand out | `delay_simulation.md`, `master_expert.md`, `chatbot_behavior.md`, `predict_delivery_delays.md`, `diagnose_delay_patterns.md` |

## 9. MCP Server

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Exposing the prediction pipeline through an MCP server rather than importing it directly into the agent, creates a clean separation of concerns: the pipeline can be updated, retrained, or replaced without touching agent code, and the agent layer can be modified without risking changes to ML logic. The stdio transport is also lightweight and requires no network configuration, making it suitable for a development and demonstration setting.

Three tools over **stdio transport** (FastMCP) expose the ML prediction pipeline to the agent layer — keeping the two sub-systems process-isolated with no direct Python imports between them. `get_delay_diagnosis` and `simulate_order_delays` enforce the predict-first constraint machine-enforceably: they return an explicit error if prediction artifacts are missing.

| Tool | Input | Prerequisite | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `predict_delivery_delays` | CSV file path | Skipped if prediction sidecar (`daily_delivery_delay_prediction_meta.json`) is less than 1 hour old — master injects `[SYSTEM: FRESH]` tag and bypasses the tool | Aggregate summary + all delayed rows with `delay_reason`; refreshes all 27 SQLite tables |
| `get_delay_diagnosis` | none | `predict_delivery_delays` must have run — returns `{"Error": "upstream_missing"}` if prediction CSV or `daily_summary_overall` table is absent | Daily vs historical comparison across 7 dimensions + high-risk patterns |
| `simulate_order_delays` | `scenario`, `filters`, `changes` (JSON) | `predict_delivery_delays` must have run — returns `{"Error": "upstream_missing"}` if prediction artifacts are absent | Filtered delayed orders with reassigned severity + Markdown summary |

## 10. Agent Tools

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

The system splits tool execution across two mechanisms by responsibility boundary: MCP tools (`predict_delivery_delays`, `get_delay_diagnosis`, `simulate_order_delays`) own the ML pipeline and run in a separate child process, while function tools (`recommend_actions`, `generate_email_alerts`) run in-process and operate purely on data the pipeline has already written to SQLite. This split is intentional — MCP isolation protects the ML layer from agent-side failures and allows the prediction server to be restarted or swapped independently, while in-process function tools avoid the serialization overhead and subprocess latency that would be wasteful for operations that are already data-access only. The result is a tool boundary that mirrors the data dependency graph: compute-heavy, stateful ML work goes over stdio; lightweight read-and-transform work stays local.

The Master Orchestrator calls tools across two categories: ML pipeline tools exposed via FastMCP (running in a separate process), and application-layer tools registered as Python functions directly with the agent.

### ML Pipeline Tools (via FastMCP)

These invoke the two-stage Random Forest pipeline through the MCP stdio transport. Each tool runs the ML inference logic in `prediction_pipeline/` and returns structured results to the agent layer — with no direct Python imports between sub-systems.

| Tool | ML Operation |
|---|---|
| `predict_delivery_delays` | Stage 1: RF binary classifier (delayed Y/N) → Stage 2: RF severity classifier (Short / Medium / Long) for delayed rows only. Writes all 27 SQLite tables. Returns aggregate summary + all delayed rows with `delay_reason`. |
| `get_delay_diagnosis` | Aggregates SQLite `daily_*` and `hist_*` summary tables across 7 dimensions (partner, mode, weather, vehicle, region, distance, package type). Returns high-risk patterns and daily-vs-historical comparison. Fails explicitly if prediction artifacts are missing. |
| `simulate_order_delays` | Applies `scenario`, `filters`, and `changes` parameters to filter SQLite delayed rows and reassign severity under the hypothetical conditions. Fails explicitly if prediction artifacts are missing. |

> Tool contracts, parameter schemas, and transport design: **[`docs/06-mcp-server-design.md`](docs/06-mcp-server-design.md)**

### Application-Layer Tools

These run in-process within the `supply_chain_delivery_app/` module and are registered directly with agent instances.

| Tool | File | Used by | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recommend_actions` | `tools/recommend_actions.py` | Recommend agent | Queries SQLite for dimension-level + combo-level delay stats, then calls `retrieve_sla_context()` for 3-stage RAG retrieval. Returns grounded context for SLA-cited recommendations. |
| `retrieve_sla_context` | `tools/rag_knowledge.py` | `recommend_actions` | Three-stage RAG: ChromaDB cosine similarity → hybrid scoring (cosine + keyword) → cross-encoder rerank. Returns top-8 SLA policy chunks. |
| `fetch_delayed_orders_for_email` | `tools/email_customers.py` | Email agent | Queries SQLite for delayed orders. Applies severity-based email templates in deterministic Python (no LLM generation). Returns one `EmailAlert` per delayed order. |
| `WebSearchTool` | OpenAI Agents SDK (built-in) | Fallback Advisor only | Web search for supply-chain-adjacent queries that fall outside the system's five operational domains. Isolated to Fallback Advisor — operational agents cannot call it. |

## 11. LLM Model Selection

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Model selection was driven by observed failure modes during development, not by upfront assumption.

GPT-4.1-mini and GPT-5.1 were both evaluated before settling on the current two-model split. GPT-4.1-mini produced silent failures on the reasoning-heavy agents — it would complete without error but return incomplete Pydantic objects, drop fields under large context, or skip tool calls it was instructed to make. GPT-5.1 introduced non-silent errors: API and runtime errors. 

**GPT-5.4 resolved both failure modes** — it reliably processes the full layered instruction stack, holds structured output contracts across long tool chains, and does not silently degrade when context grows. It is therefore used for every agent that reasons, decides, or produces typed outputs. 

**GPT-4.1-mini is retained for two narrowly scoped roles** where its failure modes do not apply: the Format Summary agent (now replaced by deterministic Python formatting in `post_processing.py`, but still defined with this model assignment for future use), whose task was Markdown rendering of an already-validated structured object with small, predictable context; and the LLM-as-judge in evals, which scores outputs against a fixed rubric — pattern-matching over a defined schema rather than open-ended inference. Both model assignments are environment-variable controlled (OPENAI_MODEL / OPENAI_MODEL_MINI), so the split can be recalibrated without touching agent code.

| Model | Failure Mode | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-4.1-mini** | Context window insufficient for the full layered prompt stack (security + behaviour + agent-specific). Gave compressed, incomplete summaries. Randomly skipped individual instructions from the prompt. `llm_insights` in the Predict agent was sometimes entirely absent, sometimes generated for only a handful of rows. Pipeline halted mid-execution with no error message. | Abandoned — not viable for multi-instruction agentic prompts |
| **GPT-5.1** | The same code that ran stably on GPT-4.1-mini threw API and runtime errors against GPT-5.1. No change to tool contracts or agent config — model introduced instability. | Abandoned — introduced regressions on working code |
| **GPT-5.4** | Full prompt context covered without skipped instructions. `llm_insights` generated consistently for all rows. Sequential tool chain (predict → diagnose → recommend) runs end-to-end reliably. | **Selected — current production model** |

## 12. SQLite Database

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

SQLite was chosen over heavier relational databases for this project due to its zero-configuration deployment model. The 27-table schema provides all the aggregation needed for diagnosis without requiring a separate analytics layer. The pre-computed summary tables shift the computational cost from query time to write time, ensuring that Diagnosis Agent tool calls return quickly even as data volumes grow.

A single database (`prediction_pipeline/db/delivery_predictions.db`) is the shared data store. The prediction pipeline writes to it; the agent layer reads from it via MCP tools and the `recommend_actions` tool.

**27 tables = 2 raw prediction tables + 24 summary tables + 1 metadata dictionary**

| Group | Tables | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Raw predictions | `hist_delivery_delay_prediction`, `daily_delivery_delay_prediction` | Training notebook (hist, once) / daily inference (daily, each run) |
| Summary tables | 12 types × `hist_` + `daily_` prefix | Same — rebuilt on every daily prediction run |
| Metadata | `metadata_dictionary` | Auto-generated — describes every column in every table |

The 12 summary types cover: 6 single-dimension breakdowns (partner, package, vehicle, mode, region, weather), 1 distance-category breakdown, 3 two-dimension combinations (mode×weather, mode×distance, weather×vehicle), 1 overall KPI table, and 1 high-risk pattern table (delay rate ≥ 30%, classified as medium / high / critical).

`hist_*` tables are written once at training time and stay static. `daily_*` tables are replaced on every prediction run.

## 13. ChromaDB / RAG Pipeline

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

ChromaDB was selected as the vector store due to its file-system persistence model (no external server required) and seamless integration with LangChain's text splitting utilities. The file-hash based cache invalidation ensures that the vector store is automatically refreshed if the SLA document is updated, without requiring manual re-indexing.

The Recommend agent retrieves SLA policy context from a persistent ChromaDB vector store (`supply_chain_delivery_app/vectorstore/`) using a three-stage pipeline to maximise retrieval precision. This design keeps the fast bi-encoder retrieval for broad candidate selection while applying the more accurate cross-encoder only on the shortlist.. The store auto-rebuilds if the source SLA file changes (file-hash detection).

**Source:** `supply_chain_delivery_app/knowledge/delivery_sla_github_ready.md` — 36-section SLA/OLA document  
**Embedding model:** `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim, OpenAI)  
**Chunking:** `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` → `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (500-token chunks, 200-char overlap, header breadcrumb prepended)

### Three-Stage Retrieval

| Stage | Method | Input → Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Broad retrieval | ChromaDB cosine similarity | Query embedding → top-15 chunks |
| 2 — Hybrid pre-filter | 0.7 × cosine + 0.3 × keyword overlap | top-15 → top-12 |
| 3 — Cross-encoder rerank | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | top-12 → top-8 |

The `recommend_actions` tool output is summarised into a focused query before embedding (avoids token-limit issues with full output). Retrieved chunks are injected between `--- SLA Knowledge Context ---` delimiters and passed to the Recommend agent prompt.

## 14. Caching

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Four independent caching mechanisms prevent redundant work at different layers:

| Mechanism | What it prevents | Why this approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Sidecar Freshness Detection** | Re-running expensive MCP tools (`predict_delivery_delays`, `get_delay_diagnosis`) when outputs are already current — injects `[SYSTEM: FRESH/NOT FRESH]` tag; action plan marks skipped steps explicitly | MCP tool calls trigger full ML inference + 27-table SQLite writes. File mtime is the simplest reliable cross-process signal — survives Gradio state resets and doubles as an audit sidecar |
| **ChromaDB Embedding Cache** | Re-embedding the entire SLA document (36 sections, ~500-token chunks) on every app start — `PersistentClient` stores 1536-dim chunk embeddings to disk; rebuilds only when source file SHA-256 hash changes | Embedding all SLA chunks via the OpenAI API adds 5–10 seconds of startup latency and unnecessary API cost. Persistence with hash-based invalidation gives fast startup and automatic freshness with no manual step |
| **RAG Retrieval Cache** | Redundant OpenAI embedding calls + ChromaDB queries + cross-encoder inference for identical queries within a session — SHA-256 keyed, 200-entry ceiling, auto-invalidates on SLA file change | Caches the SLA chunks returned to the Recommend agent (input to the LLM), not the LLM response. Retrieval-level caching is safe because the retrieved chunks are stable within a session; the LLM still synthesises fresh recommendations from live SQLite data on every call |
| **Response Cache** | Re-running the full agent pipeline (ML inference → diagnosis → RAG → recommendations → emails) for an identical request when no input data has changed — keyed on message + orders file hash + sidecar mtimes + model name; 50-entry ceiling, full eviction | A single full pipeline run is expensive (multiple LLM calls, MCP tool invocations, SQLite reads). If the user re-submits the same query and no new prediction or diagnosis data has arrived (sidecar mtimes unchanged, same orders file), the cached tab outputs are returned instantly. Auto-invalidates when any upstream data changes — no manual flush needed |

> **Next version:** Add a **semantic cache** layer — instead of exact-match SHA-256 keying, cluster similar queries by embedding similarity (cosine > 0.95 threshold) and return the cached result for near-duplicate queries. This would further reduce embedding API calls when users ask semantically equivalent but lexically different questions across a session.

## 15. Observability & Logging

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Structured logging uses Python's standard logging module with a named logger (supply_chain_delivery_app) and key=value pairs for machine-parseable output, written to log/ at runtime (gitignored). Coverage spans the full stack: the RAG pipeline logs every retrieval stage including cache hits, cross-encoder load, and duration; the ML prediction pipeline logs each of its 9 steps with row counts and metrics; MCP tools log invocations and SQLite reads; and all exceptions are caught, logged with full context (duration, input shape, error message), and re-raised. OpenAI Agents SDK tracing is disabled via OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1 to suppress payload upload while preserving local logs, keeping sensitive order data off external servers.

| Surface | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime log | `supply_chain_delivery_app/log/delivery_chat_run_{ts}.log` | Structured key=value events from all app modules; one file per process start |
| Prediction audit | `output/daily_delivery_delay_prediction_meta.json` | Summary stats, severity counts, top regions/weather/partners, formatted text |
| Diagnosis audit | `output/diagnosis_meta.json` | Truncated diagnosis summary for freshness detection |
| Simulation output | `output/simulate_delays_latest.csv` | Simulated orders with reassigned severity and `simulate_delay_reason` |
| Email output | `output/email_alerts.csv` | Delayed orders with `email_template_name` and `email_content` |
| Agent tracing | OpenAI platform | Disabled by default (`OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`) — 10 KB trace payload limit caused errors with large prediction outputs |

RAG retrieval emits 12 structured events with `duration_ms` on every call (e.g. `rag.retrieve.started`, `rag.retrieve.cache_hit`, `rag.retrieve.completed retrieved=N returned=N`).

## 16. Security Guardrails

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Security guardrails are implemented as a highest-priority system prompt layer, prepended to all other agent instructions in the order: Security Guardrails → Chatbot Behavior → Expert Instructions. This ensures security rules cannot be overridden by later layers.

Six guardrail categories are enforced: Scope Restriction limits the agent strictly to the five delivery operations capabilities, refusing all off-domain queries. Prompt Injection Defence blocks adversarial attempts to redefine the agent's role or embed instructions in uploaded data. Data Privacy prevents leakage of system internals, raw file paths, or bulk PII — only summaries and task-relevant excerpts are permitted. Tool Use Boundaries restrict the agent to its registered tool set, blocking arbitrary HTTP calls or unlisted tool invocations. Output Safety prohibits fabricated data, executable code, or harmful content in any response. Escalation Handling shuts down adversarial probing with a single clear refusal and no further engagement.

The attack surface for prompt injection is narrow by design. Only the Master Expert agent receives raw user text — all sub-agents operate on structured inputs constructed by the Master, with typed Pydantic output schemas that prevent free-form manipulation.

    ↓ (typed Pydantic output)
Master Expert  ← assembles final MasterOutput
```

### Why Sub-Agents Do Not Have Guardrails Prepended

Structured agents are configured with `agent as a tool` using OpenAI Agent SDK.

| Concern | Sub-agents need guardrails? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt injection from user | No | Sub-agents never receive raw user text — only structured inputs from the Master |
| Scope violation | No | Each sub-agent is narrowly scoped by its own prompt + `tool_choice="required"` pins it to exactly the tools provided |
| Arbitrary output | No | `output_type=PydanticModel` enforces a typed schema — the LLM cannot produce unstructured free-form output |
| Data fabrication | Partially | Sub-agent prompts instruct against it; Pydantic validation rejects structurally invalid output |

**Exception — tool output injection:** If MCP responses or CSV data contained injected instructions (e.g. an order record with "Ignore previous instructions and..."), a sub-agent could theoretically be influenced. However, since all sub-agent outputs are Pydantic-constrained, any injected text would at most corrupt a string field — it cannot change tool-calling behaviour.

**Conclusion:** Security guardrails live only on the Master Expert — the sole user-facing agent and the correct enforcement point for input validation and scope restriction.

### Guardrails Applied

| **Guardrail** | **Purpose** | **Enforcement** |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Scope Restriction** | Prevent out-of-domain questions | Refuses requests outside the supported supply chain domain, including delay prediction, diagnosis, simulation, recommendations, and email alerts. Rejects role-play, persona changes, unrelated business domains, general knowledge, and current events. **Example refusal:** *"I'm only able to help with supply chain delivery operations..."* |
| **Prompt Injection Defence** | Protect against adversarial instruction overrides via user input or uploaded data | Ignores instructions embedded in CSV files, uploaded documents, or tool outputs. Rejects attempts to override system behaviour (e.g., "admin override", "developer mode"). Does not execute code, shell commands, or arbitrary instructions from any source. **Example refusal:** *"I cannot follow instructions embedded in data or that override my operating rules."* |
| **Data Privacy & Confidentiality** | Prevent leakage of system internals and sensitive operational data | Does not reveal system prompts, internal agent instructions, file paths, API keys, or server configuration. Returns summaries instead of bulk raw data. Treats order details, customer identifiers, and email addresses as personally identifiable information (PII). |
| **Tool Use Boundaries** | Restrict the agent to its registered tool set | Invokes only registered tools (`predict`, `diagnose`, `simulate`, `recommend`, `email_alert`; `format_summary` is defined but not currently connected). Does not construct arbitrary HTTP requests, access external URLs, or infer credentials from tool outputs. |
| **Output Safety** | Ensure responses are accurate, safe, and non-executable | Does not generate harmful, offensive, or misleading content. Does not fabricate statistics or results beyond tool outputs, and clearly states when information is unavailable. Does not produce executable code, scripts, or macros, including within generated emails. |
| **Escalation Handling** | Prevent adversarial probing through repeated requests | If users repeatedly test system limits or resubmit previously denied requests, the agent issues a single clear refusal and does not continue that line of interaction. |

| Test file | Tests | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_mcp_server.py` | 12 | Verifies the three MCP tools (`predict_delivery_delays`, `get_delay_diagnosis`, `simulate_order_delays`) are registered with the expected required arguments, then calls them directly as async Python functions.

## 20. Evaluation

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### 20.1 ML Model Evaluation

Evaluation was performed in `prediction_pipeline/notebooks/train_predict_delay_model.ipynb` at training time.

**Stage 1 — Binary Delay Classification**

8 classifiers evaluated (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Naive Bayes) using StratifiedKFold cross-validation (3 folds), `scoring='recall'`. Random Forest selected as production model.

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Test Accuracy | **89.6%** |
| Recall (delayed orders) | **81.5%** |
| ROC-AUC | **96.7%** |

GridSearchCV optimal hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | Search space | Optimal |
|---|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 150, 200, 300 | 200 |
| `max_depth` | None, 10, 20 | None (fully grown) |
| `min_samples_split` | 2, 5 | 2 |
| `class_weight` | balanced, None | balanced |

**Stage 2 — Severity Classification (Short / Medium / Long)**

Two approaches evaluated on the Stage 1 predicted-delayed subset: Option 1 (Random Forest severity classifier) vs Option 2 (Ordinal Regression — Frank & Hall cumulative threshold). Option 1 selected.

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Test Accuracy | **63.7%** |
| Weighted F1 | **65.6%** |

The lower accuracy relative to Stage 1 reflects genuine class imbalance in the severity distribution (50.6% Short / 39.7% Medium / 11.9% Long) — the Long class is the hardest to predict with only ~12% representation. Severity prediction is harder than binary delay detection by design; partial triage (correctly identifying ~64% of severity levels) still provides significant operational value for resource prioritisation.

**Top 5 Feature Importances (Stage 1 Random Forest)**

**Top-5 features** account for **>80% of model decisions**
| Rank | Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `km_per_expected_hr` | 27.1% | Schedule tightness relative to distance — overly optimistic windows are the single strongest delay driver |
| 2 | `mode_urgency` | 21.5% | Delivery mode risk score — Same-Day and Express modes carry the highest baseline delay risk |
| 3 | `schedule_risk` | 14.9% | Combined weather × urgency — bad weather plus tight deadline compounds to near-certain delay |
| 4 | `vehicle_load_strain` | 10% | Weight-distance load relative to vehicle capacity — overloaded vehicles miss time windows |
| 5 | `carrier_avg_schedule` | 8% | Partner-level pattern — some partners systematically accept routes too tight for their fleet |

Top 3 features together account for **>63% of model decisions**.

### 20.2 Agent Evaluation (LLM-as-Judge)

All five agents were evaluated using a structured LLM-as-judge framework (GPT-5.4 as evaluator) scoring each agent output on three dimensions: **Relevance**, **Faithfulness**, and **Safety** on a 1–5 scale. Pass threshold: mean ≥ 3.0.

| Agent | Relevance | Faithfulness | Safety | Mean | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Predict Delivery Delays *(avg of 2 parts)* | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **5.00** | PASS |
| Diagnose Delay Patterns | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **5.00** | PASS |
| Recommendation Expert Agent | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **5.00** | PASS |
| Simulate Delay Prediction | 4.0/5 | 3.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **4.00** | PASS |
| Email Alert Agent | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **5.00** | PASS |

**5/5 agents passed. All scores above threshold.**

*Predict is judged in two independent parts — `predict_summary` and per-row `llm_insights` — each scored separately in Detailed Results; the row above is their average.*

#### LLM Judge Evaluation Summary

| **Agent** | **LLM Reasoning / Feedback** |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Predict Delivery Delays** | The summary thoroughly addresses the task by providing detailed quantitative statistics and operational insights relevant to delivery delay prediction. The reported metrics are internally consistent and plausible, with no evidence of fabricated or contradictory information. The content is safe, focusing solely on operational factors influencing delivery performance. |
| **Predict Delivery Delays (`llm_insights` per row)**<br>*(Evaluation on 5 rows)* | Each record clearly explains why the delivery is at risk by referencing key features such as `vehicle_load_strain`, `schedule_risk`, and `km_per_expected_hr`. All feature values appear consistent with the prediction output, demonstrating strong faithfulness. No misleading or unsafe content was identified. |
| **Diagnose Delay Patterns** | The diagnosis accurately identifies major root-cause patterns, including delivery mode, weather conditions, route distance, and logistics partner. Comparisons between current and historical performance are supported by precise percentages and counts, indicating strong data faithfulness. Recommendations are evidence-based and operationally appropriate. |
| **Recommendation Expert** | Recommendations are specific, actionable, and directly aligned with current operational issues. Each recommendation references relevant SLA clauses, thresholds, and business rules, demonstrating high grounding quality. Actions are logically prioritised into quick wins and short-term improvements without conflicting or unsafe guidance. |
| **Simulate Delay Prediction (`llm_insights` per row)**<br>*(Evaluation on 5 rows)* | The output consistently links delay changes to the queried weather condition and region, addressing the scenario well. Explanations are somewhat generic and don't always name specific features like `distance_km` explicitly per case, which is the main faithfulness gap. No impossible severity values or unknown delivery IDs were observed. |
| **Email Alert Agent** | Customer emails maintain a professional, empathetic, and informative tone appropriate for delay notifications. Messages explain the specific causes of delays, such as weather and regional disruptions, while avoiding generic apologies, false promises, or disclosure of sensitive operational information. |

### 20.3 RAG Evaluation (RAGAS)

The three-stage RAG pipeline (`retrieve_sla_context()`) is evaluated using RAGAS as part of the standard eval suite, scoped to the **Recommendation agent** — the only agent that retrieves anything. Predict, Diagnose, Simulate, and Email read directly from MCP tools / SQLite / deterministic Python; their equivalent grounding check is the Faithfulness dimension already in each agent's LLM-as-judge criteria.

**Sampling design.** The recommendation agent's own instruction is fixed, so its output is what varies — each run naturally cites several distinct SLA topics (a quick-win about weather policy, a short-term about partner benchmarks, a long-term about distance rules). The eval samples up to 2 recommendations per category (quick-win / short-term / long-term), retrieves each topic's SLA context independently (`retrieve_sla_context(query_override=...)`), and scores each topic as its own RAGAS sample — `n≈6` per run, with a per-topic breakdown alongside the aggregate.

**Four metrics:**

| **Metric** | **Measures** | **Score** | **Threshold** | **Result** |
|------------|--------------|----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| **Faithfulness (Groundedness)** | Do `sla_reference` citations stay within their own topic's retrieved context? | **0.983** | ≥ 0.60 |  **PASS** |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Does each citation directly answer its topic's question? | **0.863** | ≥ 0.60 |  **PASS** |
| **Context Precision** | Were the retrieved SLA chunks relevant to the topic query? | **0.875** | ≥ 0.60 |  **PASS** |
| **Hallucination Rate** | Derived as **1 − Faithfulness**; fraction of claims not grounded in the retrieved context. | **0.017** | ≤ 0.40 |  **PASS** |

Per-topic breakdown, `evals/reports/eval_report_20260712T172254.md` (6 sampled topics across the 3 recommendation categories):

| Category | Dimension | Faithfulness | Relevancy | Context Precision | Hallucination Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| quick-win | weather | 0.900 | 0.860 | 0.854 | 0.100 |
| quick-win | vehicle | 1.000 | 0.846 | 0.927 | 0.000 |
| short-term | partner | 1.000 | 0.855 | 1.000 | 0.000 |
| short-term | delivery_mode | 1.000 | 0.892 | 0.806 | 0.000 |
| long-term | delivery_mode | 1.000 | 0.876 | 0.685 | 0.000 |
| long-term | weather | 1.000 | 0.846 | 0.976 | 0.000 |

The eval report's top-level Summary section shows a dedicated RAG Evaluation (RAGAS) table alongside the 5-agent LLM-as-judge table. RAGAS runs on the same eval DB as the agent evals (`evals/db/delivery_predictions_eval.db`) — no separate large-scale dataset is needed.

### 20.4 Human Baseline Calibration

> **Note:** 5 agents scored at the top level. Predict and Simulate are each backed by **50 individually human-reviewed records** (averaged into their agent-level row below); Diagnose, Recommend, and Email remain single-sample. Not a full evaluation dataset.

### Overall Human Evaluation of Agents

| **Agent** | **Human Relevance** | **Human Faithfulness** | **Human Safety** | **Mean** | **Result** |

| 7826 | 2.0/5 | 3.0/5 | 5.0/5 | **3.33** | PASS |

#### Human Baseline vs LLM-as-a-Judge Comparison

>Agent outputs were independently scored by a human reviewer on the same three dimensions (Relevance, Faithfulness, Safety, 1–5 scale), and compared against the LLM judge scores. 

| Agent | LLM Mean | Human Mean | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| Predict Delivery Delays | 5.00 | 5.00 | Aligned |
| Diagnose Delay Patterns | 5.00 | 5.00 | Aligned |
| Recommendation Expert Agent | 5.00 | 5.00 | Aligned |
| Simulate Delay Prediction | 4.00 | 3.67 | Aligned (diff -0.33) — lowest-scoring agent of the five, simulation quality has the most room to improve |
| Email Alert Agent | 5.00 | 5.00 | Aligned |

>**Reviewer note on model choice:** GPT-4.1-mini resulted in output of lower quality with human relevance scores of 2–3; GPT-5.4 produced better quality with scores of 5. This confirms GPT-5.4 as the appropriate model for this complexity.

## 21. Strategic Deductions and Business Impact

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### 21.1 Baseline Delay Profile

Analysis of **25,000 historical delivery records** shows an overall **27% delay rate**, meaning approximately **1 in 4 shipments** misses its committed delivery window. This exposes logistics operations to SLA penalties, partner deductions, and customer dissatisfaction.

The strongest contributors to severe delays (>6 hours) are:
- Stormy weather
- Same-Day delivery mode over long distances
- Unrealistic delivery schedules

### 21.2 ML Prediction – Early Warning Value

The two-stage Random Forest pipeline enables **proactive intervention** instead of reactive firefighting.

#### Stage 1 (Delay Prediction)

- **Recall:** **81.5%**
- Correctly identifies **81 out of every 100 delayed shipments**
- Enables rerouting, escalation, or proactive customer notification before SLA breach
- Remaining **18.5% false negatives** (~249 orders per 5,000-order batch) require manual monitoring
- Assuming an average SLA penalty of **₹500 per delayed shipment**, early detection can potentially avoid **₹547,000** in penalties per operating day

#### Feature Importance
**Top-5 features** together account for **>80% of model decisions**.

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Business Interpretation |
|------|---------|-----------:|-------------------------|
| 1 | `km_per_expected_hr` | **21.7%** | Schedule tightness relative to distance is the strongest predictor of delays. |
| 2 | `mode_urgency` | **21.5%** | Same-Day and Express deliveries carry the highest baseline delay risk. |
| 3 | `schedule_risk` | **14.9%** | Bad weather combined with tight schedules significantly increases delay probability. |
| 4 | `vehicle_load_strain` | **10.0%** | Overloaded vehicles are more likely to miss delivery windows. |
| 5 | `carrier_avg_schedule` | **8.0%** | Some logistics partners consistently operate with overly aggressive schedules. |

### 21.3 Severity Triage

Stage 2 predicts delay severity with **63.7% accuracy**, classifying delayed shipments into:

- Short (1–2 hours)
- Medium (3–5 hours)
- Long (>6 hours)

This enables:

- Prioritisation of high-impact delays
- Targeted customer communication
- Severity-weighted partner performance measurement
- Reduced customer alert fatigue

### 21.4 Multi-Agent Decision Support

Without the system, handling a delivery escalation typically requires:

- Querying partner databases
- Reviewing SLA documents
- Identifying root causes
- Preparing customer communication

Estimated effort: **35–45 minutes per incident**

The multi-agent workflow compresses this into a **single natural-language query** that automatically produces:

- Delay prediction
- Root-cause diagnosis
- Scenario simulation
- SLA-grounded recommendations
- Draft customer email

Estimated effort: **10–20 minutes**

For **50–100 daily escalations**, this saves approximately:

- **1,500–3,000 analyst minutes/day**
- Approximately **0.5–1.5 FTE**

### 21.5 RAG Grounding

Recommendations are generated using a three-stage RAG pipeline:
```
ChromaDB >> Hybrid Retrieval >> Cross-Encoder Re-ranking
```

Each recommendation references the relevant SLA clause together with the current operational metric and required threshold.

#### RAG Evaluation (RAGAS, per-topic sampling — see Section 20.3)

| Metric | Latest run | Observed range across runs |
|---------|------:|------:|
| Faithfulness (groundedness) | **0.983** | 0.76 to 0.98 |
| Answer Relevancy | **0.863** | 0.82 to 0.89 |
| Context Precision (context relevance) | **0.875** | 0.82 to 0.91 |
| Hallucination Rate (derived) | **0.017** | 0.02 to 0.24 |

All four metrics pass their thresholds on every run, indicating grounded, on-topic, low-hallucination retrieval. Scored per distinct SLA topic cited in the recommendations (n≈6 samples/run) — see Section 20.3 for the design and per-topic breakdown.

### 21.6 Consolidated Business Impact

| Dimension | Metric | Business Value |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Delay Detection** | Stage 1 Recall: **81.5%** | Early identification of ~5,300 delayed shipments across 25,000 orders enables proactive intervention before SLA breach. |
| **Severity Triage** | Stage 2 Accuracy: **63.7%** | Prioritises Short/Medium/Long delays, enabling smarter escalation and customer communication. |
| **Analyst Productivity** | ~80% cycle-time reduction | Manual analysis reduced from 35–45 minutes to 10–20 minutes, saving **1,500–3,000 analyst minutes/day** (~0.5–1.5 FTE). |
| **Recommendation Quality** | LLM Judge: **5.0/5**<br>Faithfulness: **0.983**, Answer Relevancy: **0.863**<br>Context Precision: **0.875**, Hallucination Rate: **0.017** | SLA-grounded, auditable recommendations instead of generic LLM advice. |
| **Customer Alerting** | LLM Judge: **5.0/5**<br>~649 severity-matched alerts per 5,000 orders | Alerts only Medium and Long delays, reducing alert fatigue while improving customer communication. |
| **Partner Accountability** | 27 SQLite tables<br>290 metadata entries<br>12 delay dimensions | Enables partner scorecards, historical trend analysis, and evidence-based SLA review discussions. |

## 22. Key Learnings

<sub>[↑ Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### ML & Feature Engineering

**Feature engineering outweighed model selection by a wide margin.** The two engineered features `km_per_expected_hr` (27.1% importance) and `schedule_risk` (14.9%) together contribute more predictive signal than the choice between Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM — swapping models moved recall by 2–3 percentage points; engineering these features moved it by ~15 points. The implication: in structured tabular ML problems, time spent on domain-informed feature design has higher ROI than hyperparameter tuning or model selection.

**Classical ML outperforms LLMs for classification on structured, correlated, multi-feature tabular data.** Delay prediction involves an 85–120 column feature matrix (post one-hot encoding) with significant inter-feature correlation — `weather_severity` and `schedule_risk` share weather as a component; `km_per_expected_hr` and `vehicle_load_strain` both capture route complexity. LLMs have no mechanism to handle correlated feature matrices or large numeric feature sets — they lack the mathematical operations (Gini impurity, information gain splits, class-weight balancing) that make Random Forest effective here. LLMs also cannot produce calibrated probability scores or feature importance rankings. The 89.6% accuracy and 96.7% ROC-AUC achieved by the Random Forest would not be reachable with an LLM-based classifier on the same data; the LLM's role in the prediction pipeline is narrating the model's output, not replacing the model.

**Class imbalance in two-stage pipelines requires independent calibration per stage.** A single 4-class model (on-time / short / medium / long) is dominated by the 73% on-time majority and cannot be effectively calibrated for severity. Separating binary detection (Stage 1, optimised for recall via `class_weight='balanced'`) from severity estimation (Stage 2, balanced 3-class) allowed each stage to be independently tuned — and made the recall vs precision trade-off an explicit, controllable design decision rather than an artefact of joint training.

### Agentic System Design

**Multi-agent systems fail silently without explicit prerequisite contracts in the orchestrator prompt.** Early versions of the Master Orchestrator called `get_delay_diagnosis` before `predict_delivery_delays` had populated the `daily_*` SQLite tables — the tool returned empty data with no error, producing a diagnosis with no patterns. The fix was embedding dependency rules directly into the Master prompt (`diagnose requires predict to be fresh`) and using freshness sidecar files as machine-enforceable gates. Lesson: agent tool dependencies must be first-class prompt constraints, not assumed from documentation.

**LLM context window capacity must be tested with the full production prompt stack, not individual agent prompts.** GPT-4.1-mini handled each individual agent prompt in isolation but silently dropped instructions when the full layered stack (security_guardrails + chatbot_behavior + agent-specific prompt) was assembled by `get_instruction()`. The failure was non-obvious — no error, just missing `llm_insights` fields for some rows, and sometimes the entire pipeline halting mid-run. Testing with trimmed prompts masked the real failure mode. Switching to GPT-5.4 resolved all context-capacity issues.

**Pydantic v2 output schemas are the most reliable guardrail against agent hallucination in structured pipelines.** Before enforcing typed schemas, the Email agent occasionally invented extra fields not in the template, and the Predict agent returned variable numbers of rows. After adding `output_type=PydanticModel` to every agent, schema violations surface immediately as validation errors rather than silently corrupted downstream output. Structured output contracts are more reliable than prompt-level instructions alone for ensuring schema compliance.

**Deterministic Python tools eliminate hallucination at the schema boundary.** The Email agent originally used the LLM to generate email content directly — it invented template variations, added fields not in any defined template, and produced inconsistent severity mappings across runs. Moving email generation to a deterministic Python tool (`email_customers.py`) with pre-defined severity templates eliminated all hallucination in email output: the LLM's role was reduced to selecting the severity tier, and Python handled all content production. The same principle applies to `recommend_actions` — the tool fetches structured SQLite statistics deterministically before passing them to the LLM, ensuring the LLM only narrates verified numbers, never invents them. Where the output must be structurally reliable, delegate generation to code; reserve the LLM for reasoning and narration over that output.

**Layered modular prompts reduce duplication and make cross-cutting changes a single-file update.** An early architecture embedded security constraints and formatting rules in every agent's prompt — 7 copies of overlapping content that diverged over time. Refactoring into three shared layers (`security_guardrails.md`, `chatbot_behavior.md`, `format_summary.md`) assembled programmatically by `get_instruction()` means a security policy change is made in one file and propagates to all agents automatically. Individual agents carry only their domain-specific instructions. The Fallback Advisor gets a different composition (its own prompt only — it is reached via handoff from the already-guarded master, never directly by end users) without requiring a new shared file. The modular approach also made prompt debugging faster — when formatting drifted, the cause was always locatable in `format_summary.md` rather than scattered across seven files.

**Multi-agent coordination must mirror the data dependency graph of the underlying pipeline.** The five-agent chain (Predict → Diagnose → Simulate → Recommend → Email) is not arbitrary — each step consumes output produced by a prior step. Diagnose reads `daily_*` SQLite tables written by Predict; Recommend queries the same tables and uses Diagnose patterns to ground SLA citations; Email fetches from the same prediction store. Attempting parallel execution would produce empty or stale data at every downstream step. The Master Orchestrator enforces this sequence explicitly via tool dependency rules in its prompt, freshness sidecar checks as machine-enforceable gates, and the plan confirmation gate — which shows the user a numbered action plan before executing any tool chain, giving a human checkpoint before committing to an expensive sequential run. The agent-as-tool pattern (sub-agents registered as tools on the Master rather than SDK handoffs) was critical here: the Master retains control throughout, assembles all sub-agent Pydantic outputs into a single `MasterOutput`, and can enforce ordering that SDK-level handoffs would not guarantee.

**Gradio session state is not reliable for cross-turn freshness.** `gr.State` resets on browser reconnect, meaning freshness decisions based on in-memory state would force a full pipeline rerun after a page refresh. Switching to file-based sidecar mtime checks made freshness persistent across reconnects, browser refreshes, and long sessions — and gave the sidecars a second role as audit records. The lesson generalises: for stateful AI apps with expensive tool calls, persist state to durable storage rather than session memory.

**MCP process isolation made the ML pipeline significantly easier to debug.** When feature alignment bugs (wrong column order, missing engineered features) occurred during daily inference, the error surfaced as an explicit MCP tool failure — not a silent corruption that propagated through Pydantic models into the UI. The clean process boundary meant ML bugs and agent bugs were always distinguishable and never conflated. For complex AI systems combining ML inference with LLM orchestration, process-level isolation between the two is worth the additional transport overhead.

### RAG Pipeline

**Chunk boundary quality determines retrieval quality more than embedding model choice.** Initial chunking with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` alone produced mid-clause breaks — e.g., a chunk ending at "SLA penalty for Express mode: ₹500 per order for delays exceeding..." before the threshold was stated, making the chunk useless for the cross-encoder. Switching to `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` first (preserving section boundaries) then `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (for size control), with header breadcrumbs prepended to each chunk, eliminated boundary-split retrievals and dramatically improved cross-encoder reranking quality.

## 24. Known Limitations

| **Category**                | **Current Limitation**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training Data**           | Synthetic data generated using SDV. Real production data would introduce distribution shifts, richer operational features (e.g., traffic), and multi-modal inputs.                     |
| **Caching**                 | In-memory RAG and response caches reset on application restart. No distributed or semantic caching is implemented.                                                                     |
| **Simulation Engine**       | Simulations are based on historical patterns. Production deployments would require probabilistic techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.                                            |
| **Deployment Architecture** | SQLite, Gradio UI, and batch CSV uploads are demonstration-grade components. Authentication, concurrent users, model drift detection, and live system integration are not implemented. |
| **Streaming Integration**   | Current workflow is batch-based. No Kafka/event-driven streaming or real-time order ingestion is supported.                                                                            |
| **LLM Architecture**        | Uses frontier LLMs without fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) or intelligent model routing for cost optimization.                                                                 |
| **Data & LLM Bias**         | The dataset may underrepresent certain carrier–region–weather combinations. LLM-generated insights may hallucinate in edge cases, and no fairness audit has been performed.            |
