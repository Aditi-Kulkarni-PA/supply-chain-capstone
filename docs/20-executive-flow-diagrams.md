## Diagram 1 — System Architecture Overview

*Suggested slide title: "Two-Sub-System Architecture"*

Shows the full system decomposed into its two independently deployable sub-systems, the MCP integration boundary, and all five business outputs. Use this as the "how it all fits together" slide.

**Critical design decisions this diagram illustrates:**

- **Two decoupled sub-systems** — ML pipeline (offline, Python/sklearn) and GenAI app (runtime, OpenAI Agents SDK) are independently deployable. MCP stdio is the only integration boundary, meaning either sub-system can be replaced without touching the other.
- **Sequential dependency enforcement** — the agent chain runs predict → diagnose → simulate → recommend → email → format in strict order. Downstream agents (diagnose, simulate, recommend) read from SQLite tables that the predict step has already written; running them out of order produces explicit MCP errors rather than silent failures.
- **Freshness gate** — sidecar JSON files act as lightweight TTL markers. If prediction data is < 1 hour old, the Master Orchestrator skips the full ML inference step, cutting latency without user intervention.
- **Format Agent isolated** — GPT-4.1-mini (not GPT-5.4) handles pure markdown formatting as the final pass. No security guardrail layer is injected because it is internal-only and never receives raw user text.

## Diagram 2 — Multi-Agent Orchestration & Intelligence Design

*Suggested slide title: "From Natural Language to Structured Insight"*

Traces the full execution path of a "Run Full Analysis" query through every system layer. Annotated with the key reliability and security mechanisms at each step. Use this as the "how the AI actually works" slide.

**Critical design decisions this diagram illustrates:**

- **3-layer prompt injection order** — security guardrails are assembled first in `get_instruction()`, making them impossible to override by later prompt sections or user input. Sub-agents never receive raw user text; they only receive structured inputs constructed by the master, so guardrails are correctly centralised.
- **Pydantic v2 contracts as reliability layer** — every specialist agent outputs a typed schema, not free text. MasterOutput aggregates all 11 fields. A hallucinated or structurally wrong response from any agent is caught and rejected before it reaches the UI.
- **Agent-as-tool vs handoff pattern** — Master Orchestrator retains control throughout (agent-as-tool), rather than handing off to a sub-agent that then controls execution (swarms pattern). This enables central error handling, retry logic, and guaranteed sequential dependency.
- **3-stage RAG for grounded recommendations** — using a cross-encoder re-ranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) as the final stage ensures the top-8 SLA chunks are genuinely the most semantically relevant, not just the closest cosine vectors. Recommendations cite real policy, not hallucinated best practices.
- **4 caching mechanisms eliminate redundant computation** — a full ML inference run takes several seconds. Sidecar freshness check allows any agent to skip its ML call if results are already < 1 hour old; ChromaDB hash invalidation ensures the SLA embedding is automatically refreshed if the policy document changes.

## Diagram 3 — ML Two-Stage Prediction Pipeline & Key Findings

*Suggested slide title: "The ML Engine — Feature Engineering Drives Accuracy"*

Traces the full ML pipeline from raw Kaggle data to the two-stage Random Forest models, with the top feature importances and final metrics. Use this as the "what the ML learned" slide — the core analytical finding.

**Key ML findings this diagram illustrates:**

- **Feature engineering was the decisive step** — the three engineered features that dominate the model (`km_per_expected_hr`, `mode_urgency`, `schedule_risk`) together account for >63% of all tree split decisions. None of the raw categorical fields (delivery partner, vehicle type, region) appear in the top 5, confirming that raw data alone was insufficient.
- **km_per_expected_hr (r ≈ 0.59) is the primary operational lever** — schedule tightness relative to distance is the single most predictive variable. This means operations teams can directly reduce delay risk by adjusting expected delivery windows, without changing routes or partners.
- **Two-stage design over single 4-class model** — a single multi-class model would have the 73% on-time majority class overwhelm the severity classes during training. Splitting into two stages allows Stage 1 to maximise recall (catching as many delays as possible) and Stage 2 to optimise separately for severity accuracy — objectives that are in direct tension within a single model.
- **Metadata JSON enables safe daily inference** — both `.pkl` files ship with a `feature_names_in_` metadata file. The daily batch prediction script (`daily_predict.py`) reorders and zero-fills columns to exactly match training layout before calling `model.predict()`, preventing silent misalignment when new one-hot columns appear in fresh data.
- **Stage 2 accuracy (63.7%) is expected, not a failure** — severity prediction is a fundamentally harder signal, the 50/40/12 class imbalance makes it genuinely ambiguous, and weighted F1 (65.6%) is the correct metric here. The two-stage chain still enables meaningful operational triage: even a rough severity classification allows prioritised customer communication and logistics re-routing.
