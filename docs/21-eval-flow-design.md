# Eval Flow Design — Supply Chain Delivery App

## Overview

This document describes the evaluation (eval) framework for the `supply_chain_delivery_app`. All eval code lives in the `evals/` directory. The existing app, agents, tools, and tests are untouched.

---

## Agent Inventory

| # | Agent | Tool Type | Tool Name | Output Model |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | `predict_delivery_delays_agent` | MCP | `predict_delivery_delays` | `DeliveryDelayPredictionResult` |
| 2 | `diagnose_delay_patterns_agent` | MCP | `get_delay_diagnosis` | `DelayDiagnosisResult` |
| 3 | `delay_simulation_agent` | MCP | `simulate_order_delays` | `SimulationsList` |
| 4 | `recommendation_agent` | Function tool | `recommend_actions` + RAG (internal) | `RecommendedActionsList` |
| 5 | `email_alert_agent` | Function tool | `fetch_delayed_orders_for_email` | `EmailsList` |

The RAG pipeline (`retrieve_sla_context`) is embedded inside `recommend_actions` — not a separate agent tool, but evaluated via RAGAS in `test_eval_rag.py`.

`fallback_advisor_agent` and `format_summary_agent` are out of scope for evals.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Zero disruption**: `evals/` is a standalone directory. Nothing in `supply_chain_delivery_app/` is modified.
2. **Real LLM, controlled inputs**: Evals call real OpenAI APIs. DB and file I/O are redirected via env vars.
3. **Isolated eval DBs**: Evals write to `evals/db/delivery_predictions_eval.db` and `evals/db/delivery_predictions_eval_ragas.db`. Production DB is never touched.
4. **Full production input**: All evals run against the full 5 000-row input (`daily_delivery_logistics_1.csv`). The judge evaluates final text output — cost is determined by output length, not input size.
5. **LLM-as-judge on all 5 agents**: One LLM call per agent scoring relevance, faithfulness, and safety on a 1–5 scale.
6. **RAGAS on real recommendation output, sampled per-topic**: `recommend_actions()` runs once per eval, same as production. RAGAS then scores faithfulness/answer-relevancy per distinct SLA topic cited in the output (see Section 6) rather than one blended sample — see "Update (2026-07-12)" at the bottom of this doc below for why.
7. **Structured output as ground truth**: Pydantic models define the schema contract — passing schema validation is the baseline check for every agent.

## How to Run

From the `0_supply_chain_capstone/` directory:

| Command | What it runs |
|---------|-------------|
| `uv run python evals/run_evals.py` | Full suite — 5 agent evals + RAG/RAGAS + human-baseline calibration (recommended) |
| `uv run python evals/run_evals.py --agent <name>` | Single agent: predict / diagnose / simulate / recommend / email / rag |
| `uv run pytest evals/test_eval_predict.py -v` | Single agent (direct pytest) |
| `uv run pytest evals/ -v` | Full suite via pytest directly |

Notes:
- RAGAS metrics run as part of the standard suite (`test_eval_rag.py`); there is
  no separate gating flag. The former `--ragas` flag and `ragas` pytest marker
  were vestigial (no test carried the marker) and have been removed.
- A `master` single-agent option existed historically; `test_eval_master.py`
  was removed and the option with it. Master-level behaviour is exercised via
  the app flow and covered indirectly by the per-agent evals.

Each run writes to `evals/reports/`: `eval_report_<ts>.md`,
`judge_scores_<ts>.json` + merged `judge_scores_latest.json`, the raw pytest
`<ts>.json`, and (when the baseline tests run) `human_baseline_report_<ts>.md`.

## Shared Infrastructure

### DB Isolation

| DB file | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `delivery_predictions.db` | `prediction_pipeline/db/` | Production — never touched by evals |
| `delivery_predictions_eval.db` | `evals/db/` | Standard agent evals — full 5K-row input |
| `delivery_predictions_eval_ragas.db` | `evals/db/` | RAGAS eval |

Eval DBs live in `evals/db/` — they are eval infrastructure, not ML pipeline artifacts. The prediction pipeline writes to wherever `SC_PREDICTION_DB_PATH` is set; `conftest.py` overrides this to `evals/db/` before any test runs.

The `seeded_eval_db` fixture sets `SC_PREDICTION_DB_PATH` to the eval DB, copies `hist_*` tables from the production DB (read-only), and runs `DailyPredictionPipeline` to populate the `daily_*` tables. The RAGAS eval reuses the same eval DB — no separate large-scale seeding needed.

### Email Row Cap

`SC_EMAIL_MAX_ROWS` controls how many delayed orders are processed for email generation. Default: `10` for development, `3` for evals, `0` for unlimited (production).

### Fixture Execution Order

1. `set_eval_db` (autouse) — redirects DB path to eval DB and sets `SC_EMAIL_MAX_ROWS=3`
2. `pipeline_mcp_server` — starts the MCP stdio server
3. Predict eval runs first to populate the eval DB; downstream evals (diagnose, recommend, email) read from it

### LLM-as-Judge Rubric

The judge scores each agent's output on three dimensions (1–5 scale). Pass threshold: mean ≥ 3.0.

| Agent | Judge Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| Predict | Quantitative derived-feature stats cited; cross-functional factors referenced (vehicle + weather + route) |
| Diagnose | Specific root cause patterns named; daily vs historical numbers cited |
| Simulate | Condition changes explained; severity changes attributed to specific factors |
| Recommend | Recommendations specific and data-backed; SLA references cite actual policy targets; categorization logically consistent |
| Email | Tone appropriate for severity level; template matches severity (Long/Medium/Short); personalized fields filled correctly |

## Per-Agent Eval Design

### 1. Predict Agent (`test_eval_predict.py`) — MCP tool

**Schema + content checks:**

| `delayed_orders` non-empty | Count ≥ `MIN_DELAYED_ORDERS` |
| `llm_insights` references features | Each insight mentions ≥ 1 of: schedule risk, vehicle load strain, km per expected hour, vehicle type |
| Latency | < `MAX_PREDICT_LATENCY_S` |

**LLM-as-judge:** Passes `predict_summary` + 5 sample `llm_insights` to judge.

**LLM-as-judge:** Passes `diagnosis_summary` to judge.

**Prerequisite:** Predict must have run first to populate the eval DB.

---

### 3. Simulate Agent (`test_eval_simulate.py`) — MCP tool

**Schema + content checks:**

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Tool called | `simulate_order_delays` appears in result tool calls |

| Output schema valid | `RecommendedActionsList` Pydantic validation |
| 9+ total recommendations | Count ≥ `MIN_RECOMMENDATIONS` |
| Category balance | `quick-win`, `short-term`, `long-term` counts each ≥ 3 |

| Latency | < `MAX_RECOMMEND_LATENCY_S` |

**Inline RAG grounding (no extra API calls):**

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| SLA context retrieved | Tool output contains SLA Knowledge Context block |
| SLA terms present | At least one `sla_reference` contains: SLA, OLA, penalty, threshold, or target |
| No hallucinated SLA | Each `sla_reference` has a 4+ word phrase traceable verbatim to `delivery_sla_github_ready.md` |

**LLM-as-judge:** Passes all `recommended_actions` to judge.

---

### 5. Email Agent (`test_eval_email.py`) — Function tool

**Schema + content checks:**

| Check | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Tool called | `fetch_delayed_orders_for_email` appears in result tool calls |
| Output schema valid | `EmailsList` Pydantic validation |
| At least 3 emails | Count ≥ `MIN_EMAILS` |
| Template correctness | Long → subject contains "Urgent"; Medium → "Moderate"; Short → "Minor" |
| `email_content` non-empty | Each email body length > 100 chars |
| Latency | < `MAX_EMAIL_LATENCY_S` |

**LLM-as-judge:** Passes 3 sample emails (one per severity level) to judge.

---

### 6. RAG Eval (`test_eval_rag.py`) — RAGAS, sampled per SLA topic

**Not gated.** Runs as part of the default `uv run pytest evals/ -v` suite — no flag or marker needed.

#### Why per-topic sampling instead of one blended query

The recommendation agent's instruction is fixed (`"Recommend ways to optimize delivery timelines and reduce delays"`) — it never varies run to run, so varying *that* query wouldn't give RAGAS a meaningful spread of samples to average over. The original design ran `recommend_actions()` once, concatenated every `sla_reference` citation into one response string, and scored it against one shared retrieved-context block as a single `n=1` RAGAS sample. That is a genuinely noisy setup: RAGAS's Faithfulness metric has an LLM decompose the response into atomic claims and judge each against context, and with n=1 there is no averaging to smooth out that judge LLM's own run-to-run variance — observed faithfulness swung ~0.80–0.94 across identical, unchanged code.

The fix isn't a retrieval-depth tweak (we tested narrowing the final rerank to top-5 and broadening upstream retrieval — neither reliably improved or stabilized the score; broadening made the spread *worse*). Instead: the recommendation agent's **output** naturally cites several distinct SLA topics per run — a quick-win about weather policy, a short-term about partner benchmarks, a long-term about distance rules. `retrieve_sla_context()` gained an optional `query_override` param so the eval can issue a **separate, independently-retrieved query per topic**, bypassing `_summarize_query()`'s tool-output heuristic on purpose (that heuristic is still exercised for real inside `recommend_actions()` — this override exists only for eval sampling, not production).

#### What it tests

1. Runs `recommendation_agent` once against the eval DB (unchanged from before).
2. Selects up to 2 `recommended_actions` per category (quick-win / short-term / long-term) with a non-empty `sla_reference`.
3. For each selected action, builds a topic query — `"What does the SLA say about {dimension} — {action}?"` — and calls `retrieve_sla_context(tool_output="", query_override=topic_query)` to retrieve that topic's own SLA chunks independently.
4. Builds one RAGAS `SingleTurnSample` per topic (`response=action.sla_reference`, `retrieved_contexts=<that topic's chunks>`) — a real `n≈6` dataset.
5. Scores four metrics per topic (see below), and reports a per-topic breakdown table (category, dimension, action, faithfulness, relevancy, context precision, hallucination rate) alongside the aggregate — so a low score is attributable to a specific SLA citation, not lost inside one blended number.

**RAGAS Metrics (mean across ~6 topic samples):**

| Metric | What it measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `faithfulness` (groundedness) | SLA reference claims stay within their own topic's retrieved SLA context — no hallucinated policies | ≥ 0.60 |
| `answer_relevancy` | Each `sla_reference` actually answers its topic's question | ≥ 0.60 |
| `llm_context_precision_without_reference` (context relevance) | Are the retrieved SLA chunks actually relevant to the topic query, independent of what the agent did with them? Uses the same `user_input`/`retrieved_contexts`/`response` fields already collected per sample — no extra retrieval call. | ≥ 0.60 |
| `hallucination_rate` | Derived as `1 - faithfulness` (not a separate RAGAS metric / LLM call) — fraction of claims not grounded in context | ≤ 0.40 |

Added 2026-07-12: the eval originally scored only `faithfulness` + `answer_relevancy`. `LLMContextPrecisionWithoutReference` was added (reuses existing sample fields, so no new retrieval or data collection) and `hallucination_rate` is now explicitly reported as the complement of faithfulness — closing the gap against a 4-dimension rubric (context relevance / groundedness / answer relevance / hallucination rate) that the original 2-metric design only half covered. Also fixed a report-writer bug in `conftest.py`: the RAGAS score table's Pass/Fail column assumed every metric is higher-is-better, which silently inverted the correct/incorrect read for `hallucination_rate` (a low value is good). The writer now branches on metric name for the correct pass direction.

#### Query design fix — Context Precision was a bare pass (2026-07-12)

`llm_context_precision_without_reference` initially scored 0.552 — a bare pass against the 0.55 threshold, close enough to look like it might have been reverse-engineered from the result (it wasn't; the threshold was set before the first run, just copied from `faithfulness`'s pre-existing 0.55 without independently justifying it for this metric).

Root cause, found by cross-referencing the actual query text against real scores: the per-topic retrieval query was `f"What does the SLA say about {action.dimension} — {action.action}?"` — concatenating a raw `dimension` field with the recommendation's prescriptive **action** sentence (e.g. "Pause express dispatches in stormy lanes..."). Checking real section headers in `delivery_sla_github_ready.md` (Section 3.2 "Weather-Specific Operational Protocols", Section 7.2 "Partner Performance Tiers and Routing Priority") confirmed the SLA doc is organized by operational **condition**, not by recommended remedy. Same `dimension` value ("delivery_mode") produced wildly different precision (0.321 vs 0.812 vs 0.342) across different action-sentence phrasings in one run — the action sentence, not the dimension, was driving the noise.

Fix: split into two separate strings per topic instead of one.
- `retrieval_query` — terse, keyword-dense, built from `action.supporting_data` (the actual operational condition, e.g. `"weather: express + stormy 100% delayed (206/206)"`) plus a single primary dimension. Compound dimensions (`"delivery_mode + weather + region"`) are de-duplicated to the first token — asking about 3 concepts at once dilutes the embedding against a doc organized by single topic per section. This is the string actually passed to `retrieve_sla_context(query_override=...)`.
- `topic_question` — a natural-language question over the same condition, used only as RAGAS's `user_input` field (what `AnswerRelevancy` and `ContextPrecision` judge against). Kept separate because those metrics want a coherent question to reason about, even though a terse string retrieves better.

Result across four consecutive runs: Context Precision 0.552 → 0.825 → 0.907 → 0.866 — a reproducible fix, not noise. The eval report's top-level `## Summary` section now also includes a dedicated "RAG Evaluation (RAGAS)" table (pulled from whichever record carries `ragas_scores`) alongside the 5-agent LLM-as-judge table, rather than leaving RAGAS scores only inside Detailed Results.

**Known limitation:** averaging 6 topics did not eliminate run-to-run variance in the aggregate score (observed range ~0.76–0.91 faithfulness across repeated runs) — RAGAS's per-claim judging noise persists at this sample size. What changed is diagnostic: the per-topic table now shows *which* citation was weak on a given run (it isn't the same topic each time), which is actionable in a way a single blended score never was.

## Update (2026-07-04) — Human Baseline Uses Latest Judge Scores

`pytest_sessionfinish` now also writes machine-readable judge scores to
`evals/reports/judge_scores_<timestamp>.json` and `judge_scores_latest.json`.
The human-baseline comparison (`test_eval_human_baseline.py`) reads the LLM
side from the judge's in-memory records when it runs inside the same pytest
session as the agent evals (no file write-ordering dependence), else from
`judge_scores_latest.json` — so it always reflects the most recent
eval run — while human scores continue to come from `human_scores.xlsx`
(never modified). The `llm_*` columns in the sheet are used only as a fallback
when no eval run has been recorded, and the report header states which source
was used.

---

## Update (2026-07-12) — Human Baseline Migrated to .xlsx, Predict/Simulate Now 50 Records Each

`human_scores.xls` was replaced with `human_scores.xlsx` (a genuine format change,
not a rename — `file` reports it as "Microsoft Excel 2007+"). `xlrd>=2.0.2`
cannot read `.xlsx` at all (support was dropped upstream), so `test_eval_human_baseline.py`
and `llm_judge_eval.py` were migrated to `openpyxl` — both were completely
broken (`FileNotFoundError` on the old path) until this fix. `xlrd` removed
from `pyproject.toml`; `openpyxl` added.

The workbook now has three sheets, not one:
- `human_scores` — unchanged: 5 rows, one per agent, the sheet every test and
  the report's Summary/Relevance/Faithfulness/Safety tables key off.
- `PredictDelayRecords` / `SimulationRecords` — new: 50 individually
  human-reviewed records each, backing the Predict / Simulate rows in
  `human_scores` as their mean. `_load()` now targets the `human_scores` sheet
  by name explicitly (was `sheet_by_index(0)` — fragile now that there are
  multiple sheets); a new `_load_detail_sheet()` reads the other two.

Added `test_detail_records_match_summary` — asserts the two detail-sheet
averages equal their agent's row in `human_scores` to within 0.01, so the
data can't silently drift out of sync (one edited without the other). Verified
once by hand before writing the test: Predict detail mean (5.00, 5.00, 5.00)
and Simulate detail mean (3.00, 3.00, 5.00) both matched exactly.

Report gets a new "## 5. Detailed Per-Record Reviews" section: up to
`DETAIL_DISPLAY_CAP` (5) rows per agent, plus the same average-matches-summary
check inline, plus a pointer to the full 50-row sheet in the workbook —
matching README's parallel tables in §20.4.

---

## Update (2026-07-12) — Per-Topic RAGAS Sampling

**Also fixed the same session:** `test_eval_predict.py` was judging `predict_summary`
and per-row `llm_insights` as one blended text; the summary's length crowded the
insights out of the report's truncated output block. Split into two judge calls
(`Predict Delivery Delays — Summary` / `— LLM Insights`); `judge.grouped_scores()`
averages per-part records with a matching `" — "` prefix back into one row for the
top-level report table and `judge_scores_latest.json`, so the human-baseline
comparison still matches on the plain agent name. `conftest.py`'s report
truncation was raised 3000→5500 chars (also applied to the judge's own input
truncation in `judge.py`) so both parts render in full.

**RAG eval redesign:** `test_eval_rag.py` previously ran RAGAS on a single
blended sample (all `sla_reference` citations concatenated, scored against one
shared retrieved-context block) — genuinely `n=1`. Observed faithfulness swung
~0.80–0.94 across otherwise-identical runs (verified by rerunning with zero code
changes), which is expected for a single-sample LLM-judge metric but made a real
score drop indistinguishable from noise.

Two retrieval-depth hypotheses were tested and rejected before the redesign:
narrowing the final cross-encoder rerank stage from top-8 to top-5 (single run:
0.786 faithfulness — no better than baseline), and broadening upstream retrieval
from `TOP_K=15/HYBRID_PRE_FILTER_N=12` to `20/16` (two runs: 0.696 and 1.000 —
*wider* spread, not narrower). Both were reverted; `rag_knowledge.py`'s retrieval
constants are unchanged from the original committed values.

The actual fix, per repo owner direction: since the recommendation agent's own
instruction never varies, vary the *retrieval query* per distinct SLA topic the
agent's output already cites instead. See Section 6 above for the resulting design —
`query_override` on `retrieve_sla_context()`, up to 2 sampled actions per
category, one RAGAS sample per topic (n≈6), plus a per-topic breakdown table in
the report. `conftest.py`'s RAG→Recommendation merge logic (which folds RAGAS
scores into the `Recommendation Expert Agent` row when both tests run in one
session) was extended to also carry over the per-topic breakdown text, which the
merge previously discarded.

Net result: the aggregate score is still noisy run to run (observed ~0.76–0.91)
— per-topic sampling didn't fix that, and neither did the retrieval-depth
changes — but the report now shows *which* topic was weak on a given run, which
the single blended score never could.
